# Classification-and-Regression-models
This repository contains examples of machine learning classification and regression models. It includes projects that demonstrate various techniques and approaches for building and evaluating these types of models.

File #1: Experimenting on a neural network model using the keras library. The layers and configuration used are a simple feedforwards neural network (or a multi-layer perceptron) for regression.
