# Projects!

This repository contains a list of simple projects related to machine learning.



Project #1: Build a Regression Model in Keras: Experimenting on a neural network model using the keras library. The layers and configuration used are a simple feedforwards neural network (or a multi-layer perceptron) for regression.

Project #2: Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction using XGBoost model

Project #3: Rain Prediction Classifier using 5 classification algorithms: Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It contains code snippets to perform imputation and handle missing values. The dataset used is specifically for Sydney. The folder also contains a dataset containing more cities for futher experimentation. 

Project #4: Classificaiton of the MNIST dataset by testing different neural network models.
